'''You are writing code to help a zoo categorize animals. 
The program has two variables breathes_air and breathes_water depending on if the animal breathes in air or water. 
Complete the program by writing your code where it says YOUR CODE HERE. We are starting with just one case, so your code should:

Check if an animal breathes_air but does not breathes_water. Print "Mammal" if breathes_air is true and breathes_water is false.

If any other state of breathes_air and breathes_water exists, print "Animal is not a mammal."

You can adjust the values of breathes_air and breathes_water, but when you submit, they must have the following values:

breathes_air = True
breathes_water = False '''



# When submitting your code, 
# make sure the value of breathes_air is set to True and 
# the value of breathes_water is set to False
breathes_air = True 
breathes_water = False

#Use operstors
if (breathes_air == True and breathes_water==False):
    print ("Mammal")
else:
    print("Animal is not a mammal")



 #if breathes_air = True
  #Mammal = True
 #else:
  #if breathes_water = False
 #Mammal = False
